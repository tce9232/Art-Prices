              Government funding getting slowly drained from higher education has led to colleges scrambling to 
              find revenue from other sources. And tuition increases have proved an easy way to shift that burden 
              onto the student: A college degree has become essential to find a well-paying job in the 
              modern work-force, as almost every job created since the recession has gone to a college graduate. 
              This gives colleges enormous leverage over students, allowing them to charge essentially any price they want.

              Another source of school funding is philanthropy. Colleges will gladly accept money from private 
              citizens, foundations or corporations. If you give enough, they might even 
              let you put your name on a building (check out the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law or Carnegie Mellon University). If you'd

              While naming rights to a building or bench may seem innocuous enough, decreased government funding

              are among the most prominent of America's elite to realize they could use college philanthropy to their political advantage. 
              By founding entire college departments and hiring professors preaching corporation-friendly
